+  Domain

The problem is drawn from the analysis of an original (non-machine-learning) study of an Abalone. This contains the physical measurements of abalones.

+  Problem statement

Prediction the age of abalones from physical measurements.
There is 4177 rows and 9 columns. we wish to improve the accuracy of predictions.

+Dataset and Inputs

The dataset to be examined is an original( non-machine-learning) study of abalone. the dateset has 4177 rows of abalones and 9 columns (SEX, LENGTH, DIAMETER, HEIGHT, WHOLE WEIGHT, SHUCKED WEIGHT, VISCERA WEIGHT, SHELL WEIGHT, RINGS); colums represent variables. sex is a nominal value( Male, Female, Infant) and others variables and continuous and rings are integers.

+solution statement

Written by Sam Waugh for his PhD thesis, he used the data to compare classification algorithms. Since then, people have used classification and regression algorithms for the prediction.

+ Benchmark

supervised model.
